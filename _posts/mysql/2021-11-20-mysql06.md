## <span style="color:#2E4C6D">GROUP BY</span>
<hr>

- 컬럼을 그룹화해서 데이터 조회하기

    - SELECT column_name FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name;

    - SELECT column_name1, column_name2, count(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name;

    - SELECT CONCAT('문자열', column_name, ' ', COUNT(*), '문자열') AS alias FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name;

        ex) SELECT CONCAT('In ', released_year, ' ', COUNT(*), ' book(s) released') AS year FROM books GROUP BY released_year;

<br>
<br>

## <span style="color:#2E4C6D">비교연산자</span>
<hr>

- `> / >= / < / <=`

- SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name > 숫자 ORDER BY column_name;

- ex)

    ```sql
    SELECT -10 > -20 AND 'a' = 'A';
    # 1

    SELECT 40 <= 100 || -2 > 0;
    # 1
    ```

    - **'true = 1' / 'false = 0' 으로 반환**

<br>
<br>

## <span style="color:#2E4C6D">AND / OR / BETWEEN / IN</span>
<hr>

- AND

    -  SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE 조건절 AND 조건절;

- OR

    -  SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE 조건절 OR 조건절;
    
- BETWEEN / NOT BETWEEN

    - SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN A AND B

        - A와 B 사이의 모든 값 조회

        - == WHERE column_name A AND column_name B
    
    - SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name NOT BETWEEN A AND B

- IN / NOT IN

    - SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (A, B, C);

        - = SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name = A or column_name = B or column_name = C;

    - SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name NOT IN (A, B, C);
    
        - SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name != A AND column_name != B AND column_name != C;

<br>
<br>

## <span style="color:#2E4C6D">CASE</span>
<hr>

- WHEN-THEN 항상 함께 사용

- 모든 WHEN-THEN이 TRUE가 아닌 경우 ELSE값 반환 (≒switch-case)

-   ```sql
    SELECT column_name,
        CASE 
            WHEN 조건절1 THEN 결과1
            WHEN 조건절2 THEN 결과2
            ...
            ELSE 결과
        END
    FROM table_name;
    ```
